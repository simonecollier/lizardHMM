Description: Hidden Markov Models have been used with animal movement data of
    all sorts. This package allows for the fitting of data with multiple 
    variables and multiple subjects with a multi-state HMM. This fitting can 
    include time-dependent covariates in the estimation of the transition 
    probablility matrix.
